Practice website to test out features

**NOTE: Not hosted on Github as it involves database management**

This website is a sample for a doctor-patient managing system that helps doctors in their work and also lets patients view their medical progress. Each time a user visits a doctor, his/her medical entry is stored in the database by doctor. Next time a user logs, he/she may view his/her entire medical history as and when needed. At the same time a doctor may view patientâ€™s medical history even before the patient visits him. This allows for an automated patient doctor handling system through an online interface.

Modules:
*	Admin Login: The system is under supervision of admin who manages the bookings made. 
*	User login/registration: Users have to first register themselves to login into the system. 
*	Medical History: System allows updating and viewing patient medical history. 
*	Doctor Search: System allows for doctor search through categories, name and location.
*	Feedback: The system has a feedback form, where user can provide feedback into the system.
